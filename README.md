About Me

Hi, I'm Christian-Wilhelm Budde — a software engineer with a degree in Electrical and Information Engineering (Dipl.-Ing. ET/IT) and more than 25 years of experience in software development. My work spans from embedded systems and desktop applications to modern web technologies.

This profile mainly showcases my personal projects and experiments, often related to [Pascal](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal), [Delphi](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Delphi), or low-level system development. Many of the repositories here were born out of curiosity or as proof-of-concept explorations. I'm particularly active in maintaining Pascal bindings (e.g., PasSFML) and exploring modern graphics output approaches in Pascal ([Graphics32](https://github.com/graphics32), AggPasMod). I also have quite some stuff, focussed mostly on audio on [my sourceforge page](https://sourceforge.net/u/cwbudde/profile/).

Lately I'm more active with [Golang](https://go.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)/[React](https://react.dev/).

I'm especially interested in the intersection of performance, clean architecture, and pragmatic engineering solutions.
