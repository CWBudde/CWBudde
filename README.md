About Me

Hi, I'm Christian-Wilhelm Budde — a software engineer with a degree in Electrical and Information Engineering (Dipl.-Ing. ET/IT) and more than 20 years of experience in software development. My work spans from embedded systems and desktop applications to modern web technologies.

This profile mainly showcases my personal projects and experiments, often related to Pascal, Delphi, or low-level system development. Many of the repositories here were born out of curiosity or as proof-of-concept explorations. I'm particularly active in maintaining Pascal bindings (e.g., PasSFML) and exploring modern graphics output approaches in Pascal (AggPasMod).

I'm especially interested in the intersection of performance, clean architecture, and pragmatic engineering solutions.
